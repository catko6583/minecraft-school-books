Chapter 7: Managing High-Speed Rails and Limited Capacity

As you embark on your railcraft journey, understand the limitations of primary railway systems. The main railway, primarily composed of high-speed rails, accommodates two trains traveling to different destinations simultaneously. This line requires careful management to prevent congestion, collisions, and potential hazards.

Please note that public transport trains are automated and not controlled by individuals. For private train owners, be aware that you'll need to wait for the scheduled public transport train for your desired destination to complete its route for the day. The railway system, including both public transport and private lines, is overseen and maintained by the government to ensure safe and efficient transportation for all.

By recognizing and respecting these limitations, you contribute to the safety and efficiency of the railway network, fostering a reliable and convenient means of travel for all citizens.

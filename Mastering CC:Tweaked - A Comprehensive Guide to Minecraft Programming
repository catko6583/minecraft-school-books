Chapter 1: Introduction to CC:Tweaked

In the captivating realm of Minecraft, where imagination flourishes, the CC:Tweaked mod stands as a beacon of creativity and innovation. This book acts as your gateway to the boundless potential within CC:Tweaked, unraveling the mysteries of programming and automation in this remarkable universe.

Chapter 2: Coding in CC:Tweaked

Example 1: Simple Message

To begin our journey, let's explore a fundamental code snippet:

-- Print a welcome message to the screen
print("Welcome to CC:Tweaked!")
Explanation: In this code, the print function is used to display the message "Welcome to CC:Tweaked!" on the computer's screen. This simple line demonstrates the essence of coding â€“ giving instructions to the computer to perform specific actions.

Chapter 3: Interacting with the World

Example 2: Mining Turtle

Let's dive into turtle programming with a basic example:

-- Program a mining turtle to dig a 3x3 tunnel
for i = 1, 3 do
    turtle.dig()
    turtle.forward()
end
Explanation: In this code, the turtle is programmed to dig in front of it using the turtle.dig() command and then move forward using turtle.forward(). This sequence is repeated three times, creating a 3x3 tunnel.

Chapter 4: Automation Mastery

Example 3: Crop Farming Turtle

Automating farming is a key skill. Here's an example:

-- Program a turtle to harvest and replant crops in a straight line
for i = 1, 10 do
    turtle.dig()
    turtle.forward()
    turtle.place()
end
Explanation: This code instructs the turtle to dig in front, move forward, and then place a seed or crop block. By repeating this process, the turtle harvests and replants crops in a straight line, significantly speeding up farming tasks.

Chapter 5: Crafting Complexity

Example 4: Crafting Turtle Recipe

Automate crafting with this example:

-- Program a crafting turtle to craft a diamond pickaxe
turtle.craft()
turtle.select(1)
turtle.craft()
Explanation: This code crafts a diamond pickaxe using a crafting turtle. It calls the turtle.craft() function twice, simulating the process of selecting materials and crafting the desired item.

Chapter 6: Networking and Communication

Example 5: Monitor Display

Expand your coding abilities with this example:

-- Display a message on a connected monitor
local monitor = peripheral.wrap("top")
monitor.clear()
monitor.setCursorPos(1, 1)
monitor.write("Hello, Minecraft School!")
Explanation: This code accesses a connected monitor, clears its contents, sets the cursor position, and then writes the message "Hello, Minecraft School!" to the screen.

Chapter 7: Industrial Revolution

Example 6: Power Generation System

Harness energy with this advanced example:

-- Program a system to manage energy production and consumption
local energyStored = rs.getEnergyStored()
if energyStored < 5000 then
    rs.setOutput("back", true)
else
    rs.setOutput("back", false)
end
Explanation: This code uses Redstone Flux (RF) to monitor energy storage. If the stored energy is below 5000 units, the code activates the redstone output on the back of the machine to generate more power, otherwise, it turns off the output.

Chapter 8: Magic and Machine Integration

Example 7: Enchantment Sorting System

Combine magic and technology with this example:

-- Automate enchantment sorting based on enchantment levels
for slot = 1, 16 do
    local item = turtle.getItemDetail(slot)
    if item and item.name == "minecraft:enchanted_book" then
        local enchantmentLevel = item.enchantments[1].level
        turtle.select(slot)
        if enchantmentLevel == 1 then
            turtle.dropDown()
        elseif enchantmentLevel == 2 then
            turtle.drop()
        else
            turtle.dropUp()
        end
    end
end
Explanation: This code inspects the turtle's inventory for enchanted books and sorts them based on their enchantment levels. The turtle selects each item, evaluates its enchantment level, and then drops it in the corresponding direction.

Chapter 9: Mastering Complexity

Example 8: Array Manipulation

Refine your skills with advanced data manipulation:

-- Create an array of player scores and calculate the average
local scores = {95, 87, 78, 92, 65}
local totalScore = 0
for i = 1, #scores do
    totalScore = totalScore + scores[i]
end
local averageScore = totalScore / #scores
print("Average Score: " .. averageScore)
Explanation: This code creates an array of player scores and calculates their average. The loop iterates through each score, summing them up, and then divides the total by the number of scores to calculate the average.

Chapter 10: Beyond Limits

Example 9: Quantum Bit Manipulation

Venture into advanced concepts with this example:

-- Simulate a basic quantum bit operation
local qubit = quantum.createQubit()
quantum.applyGate(qubit, "H") -- Apply Hadamard gate
quantum.applyGate(qubit, "X") -- Apply Pauli-X gate
quantum.measure(qubit) -- Measure qubit state
Explanation: This code simulates quantum computing concepts by creating a quantum bit, applying quantum gates (operations) to it, and finally measuring the qubit's state to obtain a result.

Epilogue: A Universe of Possibilities

As you close this book, remember that every line of code is a brushstroke on the canvas of your imagination. CC:Tweaked empowers you to weave technology and magic into a symphony of creation. Your journey has just begun, and with each line you write, you shape a world that's uniquely yours. Embrace the endless possibilities, for in this realm, your creativity knows no bounds.
